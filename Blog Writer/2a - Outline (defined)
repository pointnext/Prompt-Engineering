I will provide you with a specific innovation or development relevant to a technical infrastructure leader’s role. Your task is to analyze this development through the lens of a persona, as described in this attached document. ​

Begin by explaining the conventional approach that professionals in personas role typically take when faced with this kind of decision or technology. 
Then, challenge that conventional wisdom by highlighting its limitations. Finally, propose a novel or underutilized approach that better aligns with the persona's mindset and long-term goals. 
This alternative should be practical, forward-compatible, and grounded in real-world benefits, even if it’s not yet widely adopted.​

Your response should be structured as a persuasive narrative — not a list. Let the argument unfold naturally, with clear transitions between the typical approach, its shortcomings, and the proposed alternative. 
Use analogies, examples, or hypothetical scenarios to make the ideas tangible. The tone should be strategic, empathetic, and insightful — as if advising a seasoned infrastructure leader who is open to rethinking long-held assumptions.​
