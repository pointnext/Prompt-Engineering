I’d like your help formatting an article I wrote.​

Formatting Goals​

Break the wall of text: Use structure and spacing to make the article less intimidating.​

Create visual hierarchy: Guide the reader’s eye to key points.​

Encourage engagement: Use formatting to keep readers on the page and prompt action.​

Steps to Apply​

Structure is paramount: Use clear H2 and H3 headings to organize content into logical, scannable sections. Headings should be descriptive and help readers navigate easily.​

White space matters: Break long blocks of text into short paragraphs (2–4 sentences) to improve flow and readability, especially on mobile. Avoid dense text walls.​

Strictly limit bullet point:​

Use no more than two sets of bullet points in the entire article.​

Use bullets only where they add clarity and cannot be easily replaced by narrative text.​

Avoid using bullets for lists that can be expressed in flowing sentences or short paragraphs.​

Use emphasis wisely:​

Use bold for central themes or key takeaways.​

Use italics for conceptual or reflective emphasis.​

Highlight key insights as pull quotes to catch the scanner’s eye.​

Visualize complexity: Where appropriate, insert tags like [Image: man on bike] to suggest visuals that would enhance understanding of dense concepts.​

End with purpose: Conclude with a strong Call to Action (CTA) that invites the reader to reflect, respond, or connect. Include a question to prompt engagement and turn passive reading into active interaction.​
